  <h1>Last Week's Homework</h1>
  <p>
    Last week I asked everyone to put together a simple page using D3's enter/update/exit. Please make sure you've posted yours on your GitHub page for me to review.

  <h1>Updating your Gem</h1>
  <p>
    If any of you have updated to the new version of Mac OS X, named El Capitan, you might need to update your gem packages in order to get bundler working:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="bash">sudo gem update</code></pre>

<section>
  <h1>Open Data</h1>
  <p>
    Your final project, which I talked briefly about in the first class, is to pair a large dataset with visualizations created using D3's enter/update/exit mechanic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Companies, governments, and citizens upload large datasets onto the web for anyone to analyze, and for us, visualize.
