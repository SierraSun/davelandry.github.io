    <h2>Changing Files Locally</h2>
    <p>
      Your repository has now been downloaded as a folder. Open the new folder in your text editor, where you should see a list of the files in a panel on the left.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Click on index.html to open it, change the text inside of it, and save it. Now let's try to upload that file back to Github.com.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Uploading to your repository</h2>
    <p>
      Uploading files to your repository is called "pushing", and a push can contain several groups of changes called "commits".
    </p>
    <p>
      Commits have comments attached to them that tells the world what was changed in those files.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Push example</h2>
    <pre><code class="js">Commit: "created a new logo"
index.html
logo.png</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="js">Commit: "changed background color and title"
styles.css
index.html</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Syncing with Github.com</h2>
    <p>
      The program only lists files with changes. Check off the files you'd like to commit, and write a commit message.
    </p>
    <img class="stretch noborder" src="/images/classes/github-commit.png">
    <p>
      Click "Commit to Master", and then "Push to Origin"

    <h1>Running a<br />Local Server</h1>
    <i class="fa fa-server"></i>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Running the Site Locally</h2>
    <p>
      So you've got updating files under your belt. But what if you want to view the changes in a browser BEFORE you push to the live site? These next few steps will get your computer set up as a local server to view these files.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Using the Shell</h2>
    <p>
      PowerShell and Terminal are programs that interact with your computer through text commands. You can make folders, move files, and even launch applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commands are issued by writing the command and pressing the return key. Only 1 command can be issued at a time.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Directories in the Shell</h2>
    <p>
      When interacting with your computer through a shell, you are always issuing commands from a specific folder on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>To move into a folder, use the <u>c</u>hange <u>d</u>irectory command:</p>
    <pre><code class="bash">cd /path/to/my/folder/</code></pre>
    <p class="fragment">Use cd to go into your repository folder.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Package Manager for Github Pages</h2>
    <p>
      In order to run a Github Pages server on your laptops, you need to install a package manager for all of the software needed. Complex servers require a lot of small applications running together, and package managers will handle all of the messy stuff. Think of it like an App Store for your server software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Run this command in Terminal to install Bundler:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">gem install bundler</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      If any of these Terminal commands gives you an error mentioning invalid Permissions, you can bypass that by prefixing the command with "sudo". For example, if the previous command failed because of permissions, you can say:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">sudo gem install bundler</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will ask you for your computer password, and then force it's way through the install.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Listing Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      A Gemfile contains links to all of the package dependencies needed in order to run Github Pages locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your text editor, create a new file in your project directory called "Gemfile" (capitalized, and no file extension!). Inside that file, add these 2 lines and save it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Installing the Gems</h2>
    <p>
      And finally, issue this command from your project folder to install the dependency from the Gemfile:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">bundle install</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Actually Running the Site</h2>
    <p>
      Good, you've made it this far. I promise you'll never have to do all that stuff again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all you need to do any time you want to serve the site is type:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">bundle exec jekyll serve --watch</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Look in your browser!</h2>
    <p>
      You should be able to see your site at the following URL:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">http://localhost:4000/</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Stopping the server</h2>
    <p>
      Anytime you would like to stop the server from running (say, to commit some files to Git), you can <u><strong>cancel</strong></u> the process by pressing <u><strong>control + c</strong></u> on your keyboard while in Terminal.
    </p>
