    <h2>Clone your Repository</h2>
    <small>After following the setup instructions, including logging into your account and installing any additional software, download your repository by using the menu hidden beneath the plus sign in the top left.</small>
    <img class="stretch noborder" src="/images/classes/github-clone.png">
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Changing Files Locally</h2>
    <p>
      With your repository on your machine now, open the folder in your text editor. In there, you should see a list of the files in a panel on the left.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Click on index.html to open it, change the text inside of it, and save it. Now let's try to upload that file back to Github.com.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Uploading to your repository</h2>
    <p>
      Uploading files to your repository is called "pushing", and a push can contain several groups of changes called "commits".
    </p>
    <p>
      Commits have comments attached to them that tells the world what was changed in those files.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Push example</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Commit: "created a new logo"
          <ul>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>logo.png</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Commit: "changed background color and title"
          <ul>
            <li>styles.css</li>
            <li>index.html</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Syncing with Github.com</h2>
    <p>
      The program only lists files with changes. Check off the files you'd like to commit, and write a commit message.
    </p>
    <img class="stretch noborder" src="/images/classes/github-commit.png">
    <p>
      Click "commit to master", and then Sync!

    <h1>Running the Site Locally</h1>
    <i class="fa fa-server"></i>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Running the Site Locally</h2>
    <p>
      So you've got updating files under your belt. But what if you want to view the changes in a browser BEFORE you push to the live site? These next few steps will get your computer set up as a local server to view these files.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Using Terminal</h2>
    <p>
      The Terminal is just a different way of interacting with you computer. Just like the Finder, you can make folders, move files, and even launch applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commands are issued to the terminal by writing the command and pressing the 'return' key. Only 1 command can be issued at a time.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Windows Users</h2>
    <p>
      No judgement here, but you'll need to download a program from the web: <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org">http://rubyinstaller.org</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the big red "Download" button, then the first RubyInstallers link (which is "Ruby 2.3.1" at the time of me writing this).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Mac Users</h2>
    <p>
      Type the following command into Terminal and press return:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">xcode-select --install</code></pre>
    <p>
      A popup should appear, click ok/agree to everything it says and a progress bar wlll start. This installs some basic programming packages that Apple does not include on computers by default.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Folders in Terminal</h2>
    <p>
      When looking at your computer through Terminal, you are always issuing commands from a specific folder on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you open a new Terminal window, you start out in your Home directory (or "~/"). This is the folder on your hard drive named after your username (available in the "Go" menu of Finder).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Package Manager for Github Pages</h2>
    <p>
      In order to run a Github Pages server on your laptops, you need to install a package manager for all of the software needed. Complex servers require a lot of small applications running together, and package managers will handle all of the messy stuff. Think of it like an App Store for your server software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Run this command in Terminal to install Bundler:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">gem install bundler</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      If any of these Terminal commands gives you an error mentioning invalid Permissions, you can bypass that by prefixing the command with "sudo". For example, if the previous command failed because of permissions, you can say:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">sudo gem install bundler</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will ask you for your computer password, and then force it's way through the install.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Listing Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      A Gemfile contains links to all of the package dependencies needed in order to run Github Pages locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your text editor, create a new file in your project directory called "Gemfile" (capitalized, and no file extension!). Inside that file, add these 2 lines and save it:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Installing the Gems</h2>
    <p>
      And finally, issue this command from your project folder to install the dependency from the Gemfile:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">bundle install</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Actually Running the Site</h2>
    <p>
      Good, you've made it this far. I promise you'll never have to do all that stuff again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all you need to do any time you want to serve the site is type:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">bundle exec jekyll serve --watch</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Look in your browser!</h2>
    <p>
      You should be able to see your site at the following URL:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">http://0.0.0.0:4000/</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Stopping the server</h2>
    <p>
      Anytime you would like to stop the server from running (say, to commit some files to Git), you can <u>c</u>ancel the proess by pressing control+c on your keyboard while in Terminal.
    </p>
